            <p>This is a very long paragraph showing whatever I have learned in week 1 of the course on coursera. The course is provided by John Hopkins University
                and the course is titled as HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript for web developers.When most people think of links, they think of connecting two different webpages together. 
                You use hyperlinks to connect two of your blog posts, or a blog post and a landing page, or a blog post and a product page, or a tweet to your website.
                But that's not all hyperlinks can do. With a little tweaking, you also can set up hyperlinks to link to content on the same page. So remember that 
                really exhaustive glossary you put together on industry terms your audience should know? Now, when you refer to something you said elsewhere in that article, 
                you can actually link to it -- making it much easier for your audience to figure out what the heck you're talking about.Balloons are pretty and come in different colors, different shapes, different sizes, and they can even adjust sizes as needed. But don't make them too big or they might just pop, and then bye-bye balloon. It'll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind. 
                They can serve a variety of purposes, from decorating to water balloon wars. You just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them.
